<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Hamdi Korreshi. I am currently a Junior at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) studying computer science. 
  I am currently on the Dean's list for the third semester in a row after transferring into NJIT. I am apart of the NJIT wrestling 
  club E-board as a Captain with the responsibility of setting up, running and cleaning up for practice.
</p>

<p>My experience includes Research assistant at NJIT under Professor Sooyeon Lee, which I have been 
  working for 4 months. Under this opportunity I have lead interviews with visual impaired people 
  asking questions about VR. Afterwards I analyze the transcripts looking for common themes among them.
  Then I would add my additions to the paper and check for grammar and spelling errors.
</p>

<p>Personally I love to workout, hike, read and play video games.</p>
