<h1>Good Movies</h1>
<h2>Always in the Mood for These</h2>

<h3>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>Spider-man is all about learning how and when to use your powers responsible, way better than the new one. </p>

<h3>Dope</h3>
<p>Living in a rough area and trying to escape while being really social awkward spoke to my teenage self. Good character development, funny and a great watch.</p>

<h3>Wall-E</h3>
<p>When I was young the strange wonder of seeing a trash compacting robot fall in love while traveling the cosmos and saving Earth, was mesmerizing. 
My mother said it was the only movie that I sat down to fully watch as a child.
I thought that would fade with time yet when I went back to watch it, my butt was glues the same way.</p>
